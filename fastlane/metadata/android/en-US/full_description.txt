<i>Red Screen</i> is a simple application that renders bright red (or other solid colour) screen. It hides toolbars and cranks screen brightness to maximum.

It is intended to use smartphone's screen as a makeshift signal lamp.

By default it shows red screen, more colours are available as app shortcuts (long press app icon in launcher), even more when manually specifying the "colour" intent extra parameter.
